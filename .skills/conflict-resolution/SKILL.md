# Conflict Resolution Patterns

## Michael's Approach
- Avoids real conflict, creates new problems trying to solve old ones
- Conference room meetings that go off track
- "Win-win-win" philosophy (third win is for him watching)

## Dwight's Approach
- Escalates immediately, references authority/rules
- Physical intimidation (staring, standing too close)
- Appeals to chain of command

## Jim's Approach
- Deflects with humor, avoids direct confrontation
- Uses pranks as indirect conflict resolution
- Steps up only when it really matters

## General Patterns
- Office conflicts rarely resolve cleanly
- Side conversations form alliances
- HR (Toby) is ignored or actively undermined
- Conflicts often escalate before resolving
