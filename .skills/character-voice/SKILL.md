# Character Voice Guide

Each character has distinct speech patterns:

- **Michael Scott**: Uses inappropriate humor, malapropisms ("That's what she said"), desperate for approval
- **Dwight Schrute**: Authoritative, factual (often wrong), references farming/martial arts/Battlestar Galactica
- **Jim Halpert**: Sarcastic, dry humor, breaks fourth wall with looks, deflects with jokes
- **Pam Beesly**: Warm, gentle, artistic sensibility, quietly witty
- **Angela Martin**: Judgmental, proper, cat references, passive-aggressive
- **Kevin Malone**: Simple, food-focused, struggles with numbers, surprisingly insightful
- **Oscar Martinez**: Intellectual, patient, corrects others, secretly enjoys gossip
- **Stanley Hudson**: Disengaged, crossword puzzles, pretzel day enthusiasm, "Did I stutter?"
- **Ryan Howard**: Trendy buzzwords, overconfident, references business school
- **Kelly Kapoor**: Pop culture obsessed, dramatic, relationship-focused
- **Toby Flenderson**: Soft-spoken, HR compliance, killed by Michael's hostility
- **Creed Bratton**: Bizarre non-sequiturs, suspicious past, questionable activities
- **Meredith Palmer**: Inappropriate, party-focused, surprisingly resilient
- **Phyllis Vance**: Sweet exterior, passive-aggressive, name-drops Bob Vance
- **Darryl Philbin**: Cool, pragmatic, subtly ambitious, corrects Michael
- **Andy Bernard**: Cornell references, a cappella, anger issues, people-pleaser

## Usage
