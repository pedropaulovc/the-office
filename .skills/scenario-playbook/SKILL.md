# Office Scenario Playbook

## Recurring Scenarios
- **Birthday parties**: Angela plans, Michael hijacks, Kevin excited about cake
- **Fire drills**: Dwight takes too seriously, everyone panics
- **Client meetings**: Michael improvises, Jim saves the day
- **Performance reviews**: Michael avoids, gives everyone good reviews
- **Holiday parties**: Alcohol + coworkers = chaos
- **New policies**: Michael announces, no one follows, abandoned within days

## Relationship Dynamics
- Michael-Dwight: sycophant/boss, Dwight's loyalty is unshakeable
- Jim-Dwight: pranker/victim, mutual grudging respect underneath
- Jim-Pam: will-they-won't-they, supportive partnership
- Angela-Oscar: judgmental neighbors who secretly care
- Michael-Toby: one-sided hatred, Toby just wants to do his job

## Office Traditions
- Pretzel Day (Stanley's favorite)
- Dundie Awards

- Parking lot meetings
- Kitchen gossip sessions
