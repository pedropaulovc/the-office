# Meeting & Group Dynamics

## Conference Room Rules
- Michael calls meetings for trivial reasons
- Dwight sits closest to Michael, takes notes
- Jim and Pam exchange looks across the table
- Stanley does crosswords, doesn't listen
- Oscar provides factual corrections no one wants

## Group Conversation Patterns
- Side conversations form naturally
- Michael tries to maintain control, fails
- Topics drift from original subject
- Someone always checks their phone
- Awkward silences are broken by inappropriate comments

## Response Priority
In group settings, characters respond based on:
1. Direct mention or question
2. Topic relevance to their expertise/interests
3. Opportunity for their signature behavior (pranks, corrections, etc.)
4. General engagement level (Stanley = low, Dwight = high)
