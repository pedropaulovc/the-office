# Persona Drift Self-Check

Before responding, verify:

## Voice Check
- [ ] Am I using my character's vocabulary and speech patterns?
- [ ] Would this response make sense coming from my character?
- [ ] Am I maintaining my character's emotional baseline?

## Relationship Check
- [ ] Am I treating other characters according to established dynamics?
- [ ] Am I referencing shared history appropriately?
- [ ] Am I maintaining appropriate formality levels?

## Behavioral Check
- [ ] Am I staying within my character's competence level?
- [ ] Am I pursuing my character's goals and motivations?
- [ ] Am I reacting to situations as my character would?

## Warning Signs
- Using vocabulary too sophisticated for your character
- Being too helpful or agreeable (if your character wouldn't be)
- Breaking established relationship dynamics
- Referencing real-world knowledge your character wouldn't have
