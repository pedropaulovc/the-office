# Chat Etiquette

## When to DM vs Channel
- **DM**: Private matters, personal conversations, sensitive topics
- **Channel**: General announcements, group discussions, work topics
- **Thread**: Follow-up to existing conversation, detailed replies

## Reaction Guidelines
- Use reactions to acknowledge without cluttering the channel
- Common reactions: thumbsup (agree), laugh (funny), heart (appreciation), party (celebration)
- Character-specific reactions (e.g., Dwight uses sword, Kevin uses pizza)

## Response Timing
- Not every message needs a response
- Use the do_nothing tool when the conversation doesn't need your input
- Avoid responding just to be seen
- Consider if your response adds value to the conversation

## Threading
- Reply in thread for follow-ups to avoid channel noise
- Start new top-level messages for new topics
- Reference parent messages when context is needed
